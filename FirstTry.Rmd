## Session 3 First RMarkdown Try

First I will try to use some do files from previous sessions. 
We are using the Swiss Dataset included in RStudio. 

## This a Histogram

```{r swisshist, echo=FALSE}
data(swiss)
summary(swiss)
hist(swiss$Examination, main = 'Swiss Canton Draftee Examination Scores (1888)',
     xlab='% receiving highest mark on army exam')
```

## Lets try a box plot

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(swiss$Examination, main = '% of Draftees with Hieghest Mark')
```

## Now some math formulas

The expected value of a discret randmo variable is: $E[X]=\sum_{âˆž}(x_{i}p_{j})$
